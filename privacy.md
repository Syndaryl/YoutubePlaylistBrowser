YoutubePlaylistBrowser stores no information about your usage of the application. 
It must access the Youtube API to function, and Youtube may track those calls; this is outside of our control and we have no access to the information that Youtube may or may not collect.
Other than this possible collection by Youtube, we do not collect any information or analytics about the use of this program or send any data to a central store or third parties.

You may save your "Playlist Playlists" on your own machine; they do not contain any identifying information. You are responsible for the security of these files on your drives.
